# Store-Catalog
The purpose of this code is for a user to add books, audio books, and DVDs to a 
Catalog and display those items. The main input are the variables for the books
 and DVDs which are input as a string title, a double price, a string author or 
director, an integer ISBN or DVD code an integer year, and a double running 
time. The output is all of those variables but they are all converted to 
strings. To use this code the user selects an option and then inputs the 
information prompted. If they wish to exit the application they type option 9.
The key variables are the ones I listed above for the input.
